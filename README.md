# gravity-maze

Ever wondered what throwing a ball would be like if walls had a repulsive
gravity forces?
EXTREME GAMES OF CATCH!


### TODO

  - WIP Build - EDIT mode (click on and edit elements)

  - BUG move a line -> add a point -> line disappears
    
  - Add full integration tests.
  
  - Clear all button

  - option for bigger 'start' and click radius 

  - display element information
    
  - build-mode path simulator
  
  - Stop blocking shooting to right when against left wall
  
### Other Ideas

  - Would be fun to play on a BIG screen. More like a maze that way.

  - New element: "Tarpit" something that slows down the ball
