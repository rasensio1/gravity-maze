# gravity-maze

Ever wondered what throwing a ball would be like if walls had a repulsive
gravity forces?
EXTREME GAMES OF CATCH!


### TODO

  - Add full integration tests.
  - :finish validator

  - Undo/Redo build actions
  - Retry (reset start)
  

  - option for bigger 'start' and click radius 

  - Add start point
    - diff between just any points and the start point 
      (only allow starting from start)

  - display element information
    
  - build-mode path simulator
  
  - Stop blocking shooting to right when against left wall
  
### Other Ideas

  - Would be fun to play on a BIG screen. More like a maze that way.

  - New element: "Tarpit" something that slows down the ball
